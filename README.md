  ### *API Issue* 

Due to some reason API is not working when deployed and enabled HTTPS protocol on netlify.You can make it work if you disable the https protocol from your url. Screenshot (capture.png) is added in master repository to show the result of querry. 


Please do let me if someone with experience knows how to counter such problems when using APIs. Also is it problem with this API or netlify or me? (lol)
